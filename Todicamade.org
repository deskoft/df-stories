This is the first fully roleplayed story that I will tell.

*Todicamade* is the name of the world; if I enjoy the story I am writing, the idea is to not just limit myself to a single settlement, but immerse ourselves into the lore within this randomly generated lore that Dwarf Fortress tossed at us.

Here are a few rules or guidlines I will follow:

- Entries are written from the perspective of a single dwarf; these entries are usually written after notable events, decisions or progress, by the most important dwarf. Most commonly, this will be the highest ranking leader.
- I am playing the game in a 25 FPS cap so that I can better react to events. There's currently a 25 population cap, although it will be increased if it makes realistic sense (and if I am able to familiarize myself with all the dwarves).
- Before major decisions, I will study each of the respective dwarves and study their thoughts to represent them to the best of my abilities.
- We are tracking conversations that dwarves have in an attempt to fully immerse ourselves. Ideally, we will not miss anything this way.
- Do not expect a fast-paced Let's Play. This will be a slow Let's Play, giving you a chance to fall in love with the dwarves, or respectively hate them. Think of it as a chapter of Game of Thrones.
- We will make some meta sacrifices in lieu of simulation; do not expect to see the top-notch dwarf fortress meta skills. Expect to see Grand Halls and ample bedrooms, or random rules emerging.

* Fortress: Keskaldural (Year 250)

Keskaldural is our first fortress. A troupe of bards have found themselves lost in the middle of the wild. With low resources and not much chance of survival, they each discuss what they can do and decide to settle down - for the time being.

** Year 250
*** 250-01-15: First Arrival (Domas Rulushingish)

We have finally settled!

[[file:Images/fortress1-1.png]]

We're surrounded by trees everywhere, but I -really- think we can look at our situation two ways.

The first one is dwelling that we're in the middle of nowhere, very far away from those we love.

The second one is that we have a variety of resources at our disposal and this area gives us a decent chance of surviving.

Here is a rough sketch of a rivery we found nearby - it's awfully hidden by trees and sometimes hard to find, but it's going to prove useful, no doubt.

[[file:Images/fortress1-2.png]]

The first talk we had was about digging a place for ourselves. Kubuk quickly agreed to dig a wide hole on the ground and shape it wide enough for us to park wagons - or what ever groups happen to find us in the future (if any).

I tasked Zuntir to clear the area of some of the trees, as well, so that I can use the wood for some crafts.

Meanwhile, Eral and Olon will go around fishing to the nearby village.

And with that, we set to work.

*** 250-02-02: Problems

We've been prodding at the ground, with the first parts of our cave nearly done.

Kubuk has been finding a lot of damp sand underneath, no doubt due to the lots of water bodies nearby. It proves problematic.

But today we finally managed to find and reinforce an area down into a more solid layer.

Here are some sketches:

*** 250-02-06: Progress with the Cave

We have made some progress with the cave and we've dug past some lignite rock, hopefully being able to forget about the whole damp sand problem.

I managed to get some drinks with Kubus Mishthemoslan (Miner) and Erush Ubbulzon (Stoneworker) some days ago. We're all feeling good about having survived the first few days here. Although, we're still using our supplies, things should begin to move soon.

Both Zuntir and Eral were complaining that we're out of basic supplies like goblets. I tried to explain to them that we're taking longer to get to a point where we can move things underground and get to work on supplies, but I fear they are getting desperate.

*** 250-02-07: Finally Working on Sleeping Quarters & Central Stockpile

I've talked to Kubuk, who has agreed with my plans for two underground layers under the (now rather intricate) entrance we've made. I have some sketches here about the two levels (first one is the stockpile, second one is the bedrooms for all seven of us).

I've sent things to motion in this department.

The Sleeping Quarters are very straightforward. The idea for the Central Stockpile is to move things that way from outside, and then have working spaces for other industries.

*** 250-02-17: Doors and Beds

I've made a makeshift carpentry workshop next to the wood and I've begun working on new doors and beds for our home.

In our home, Kubuk is still digging the stockpile; I expect that to be done by the end of the month.

*** 250-02-20: Mining

Digging the stockpile was taking too long, so I told the Jeweler Eshtan Akrulartob to join in, even though he didn't seem too extraordinarily capable of digging too fast.

*** 250-03-04: Sockpile Progress

I have the beds and doors ready for our new home; both Kubuk and Esthan are working on the stockpile, still. It's taking too long and some of the other dwarves are complaining that they're sleeping on the rocks. I really hope we could be done with it faster.

It's been two months and a half now, sleeping like this.

*** 250-04-03: Concstruction Nearly Finished!

The living quarters and stockpile area nearly done! We've made a couple of areas for us to work with stone, and the bedrooms are looking really cozy so far!

There's two bedrooms that are still under construction, but here's some sketches (the first one is the stockpile with the workshops and the second one is the bedrooms as of now):
