This is the first fully roleplayed story that I will tell.

*Todicamade* is the name of the world; if I enjoy the story I am writing, the idea is to not just limit myself to a single settlement, but immerse ourselves into the lore within this randomly generated lore that Dwarf Fortress tossed at us.

Here are a few rules or guidlines I will follow:

- Entries are written from the perspective of a single dwarf; these entries are usually written after notable events, decisions or progress, by the most important dwarf. Most commonly, this will be the highest ranking leader.
- I am playing the game in a 25 FPS cap so that I can better react to events. There's currently a 25 population cap, although it will be increased if it makes realistic sense (and if I am able to familiarize myself with all the dwarves).
- Before major decisions, I will study each of the respective dwarves and study their thoughts to represent them to the best of my abilities.
- We are tracking conversations that dwarves have in an attempt to fully immerse ourselves. Ideally, we will not miss anything this way.
- Do not expect a fast-paced Let's Play. This will be a slow Let's Play, giving you a chance to fall in love with the dwarves, or respectively hate them. Think of it as a chapter of Game of Thrones.
- We will make some meta sacrifices in lieu of simulation; do not expect to see the top-notch dwarf fortress meta skills. Expect to see Grand Halls and ample bedrooms, or random rules emerging.
