This is the first fully roleplayed story that I will tell.

*Todicamade* is the name of the world; if I enjoy the story I am writing, the idea is to not just limit myself to a single settlement, but immerse ourselves into the lore within this randomly generated lore that Dwarf Fortress tossed at us.

Here are a few rules or guidlines I will follow:

- Entries are written from the perspective of a single dwarf; these entries are usually written after notable events, decisions or progress, by the most important dwarf. Most commonly, this will be the highest ranking leader.
- I am playing the game in a 25 FPS cap so that I can better react to events. There's currently a 25 population cap, although it will be increased if it makes realistic sense (and if I am able to familiarize myself with all the dwarves).
- Before major decisions, I will study each of the respective dwarves and study their thoughts to represent them to the best of my abilities.
- We are tracking conversations that dwarves have in an attempt to fully immerse ourselves. Ideally, we will not miss anything this way.
- Do not expect a fast-paced Let's Play. This will be a slow Let's Play, giving you a chance to fall in love with the dwarves, or respectively hate them. Think of it as a chapter of Game of Thrones.
- We will make some meta sacrifices in lieu of simulation; do not expect to see the top-notch dwarf fortress meta skills. Expect to see Grand Halls and ample bedrooms, or random rules emerging.

* Fortress: Keskaldural (Year 250)

Keskaldural is our first fortress. A troupe of bards have found themselves lost in the middle of the wild. With low resources and not much chance of survival, they each discuss what they can do and decide to settle down - for the time being.

** Year 250
*** 250-01-15: First Arrival (Domas Rulushingish)

We have finally settled!

[[file:Images/fortress1-1.png]]

We're surrounded by trees everywhere, but I -really- think we can look at our situation two ways.

The first one is dwelling that we're in the middle of nowhere, very far away from those we love.

The second one is that we have a variety of resources at our disposal and this area gives us a decent chance of surviving.

Here is a rough sketch of a rivery we found nearby - it's awfully hidden by trees and sometimes hard to find, but it's going to prove useful, no doubt.
